    <h2>Solution Lies within</h2>
    <br><br>
    <h3>In the process of growing up life will give you many options to step up and live your dream. But, it's all depends on you, whether you choose to step forward or live with the suffering. Doing nothing is symbol of loser, because you will give many excuses of why you can not do it. If you have only one reason to step forward you should accept the challenge.

        Now, the question if how. How you will step up? my opinion about the matter is, "solution lies within us." Many neuro-researcher agrees that our brain changes the way we think, if we can change the process of our thoughts, our brain will change the way of our living and it will be awesome life from then. By thinking of reducing the stress of problem, we starts to share our problem with the people surrounding us. But, the truth is: no one really cares about it. So, solve the problems by your own; ask the brain to do this task. If you believe in yourself, your brain will starts to modify its characteristics and it will start to help you.  
    
         At the end note I will say, "if you want to solve any problem, just believe that you can solve it," and start acting on the solution. The solution comes from within not from the outer side, because great things can only happen from inside. </h3>

   <h2>Power Of Realization</h2>
   <br><br>
   <h3>When we listen to someone's motivational talks or good speech, we got inspired or start to think about the discussed matter because we, just processed the truth in our brain.

    Now,the question is "How the spoken truth motivate us?" As of human being we have the experience of everything and we know how the life is but, if someone share same experience of life with us we, starts to think.
  
    Because we start to REALIZE the experience gained in our life . So, the important point is "ITS NOT JUST GAINING EXPERIENCE OF SOMETHING MOTIVATE US....ITS THE REALIZATION OF GAINED EXPERIENCE ."
  
    If you start to realize the truth of anything, you are going to enjoy the whole process of life.</h3>
